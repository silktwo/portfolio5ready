You are an expert full-stack TypeScript + Node.js developer working inside Replit.

Context:
- This project is deployed to Vercel.
- The dependency manager is pnpm (v10+).
- The build on Vercel fails with this message in the logs:

  ╭ Warning ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

- The flow is: I edit code in Replit → changes are pushed to GitHub → Vercel deploys from GitHub.
- I cannot run interactive commands like `pnpm approve-builds` on Vercel, so this must be solved via repo configuration.

Your task:
1. Inspect the repo in Replit and:
   - Locate `package.json`.
   - If present, also check `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `.npmrc`.

2. Configure pnpm so that the `sharp` dependency is explicitly allowed to run its build scripts during installation/build, as if `pnpm approve-builds` had been run locally. Do this by editing the config files in the repo (not by assuming any local global config).

   Specifically:
   - In `package.json`, add or merge a `pnpm` field so it contains at least:

     ```json
     "pnpm": {
       "onlyBuiltDependencies": [
         "sharp"
       ]
     }
     ```

     Make sure:
     - JSON stays valid.
     - You don’t remove any existing `pnpm` settings; merge instead of overwrite.

   - If the project already uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and it is the correct place for shared pnpm settings, you may instead (or additionally, if appropriate) ensure it contains:

     ```yaml
     onlyBuiltDependencies:
       - sharp
     ```

   - Do NOT remove the `sharp` dependency itself or downgrade it. The goal is only to approve its build script so Vercel’s pnpm install/build step succeeds.

3. Check for any strict pnpm settings that might turn this warning into a hard error on CI, for example:
   - `strict-dep-builds=true` or similar in `.npmrc`.
   - If such settings exist, keep them, but ensure the configuration for `sharp` (in `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) is correct so the build passes without warnings or errors.

4. After editing the config:
   - Run the appropriate install and build commands in Replit to verify everything works locally, for example:

     - If this is a Next.js or similar app:
       - `pnpm install`
       - `pnpm build`

     - If the project uses a different build script, run that instead (e.g. `pnpm run build` or whatever is defined in `scripts.build` in `package.json`).

   - Confirm that:
     - There is no `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` or similar error.
     - The warning about “Ignored build scripts: sharp” no longer appears.
     - The build command exits with code 0.

5. Make only the minimal necessary changes for this fix:
   - Do NOT refactor app code.
   - Do NOT change dependencies versions unless absolutely required.
   - Do NOT change Vercel config files except if there is a clear, direct need related to pnpm/sharp build scripts.

6. Finally, summarize what you changed in 3–5 bullet points so I understand:
   - Which file(s) you edited.
   - What configuration you added/updated.
   - Which commands you ran in Replit to confirm that the build now passes.

Apply all changes directly to the files in this Replit project so that, once pushed to GitHub, Vercel can deploy successfully.
