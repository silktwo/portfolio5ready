You are an expert full-stack TypeScript/Next.js developer working inside this Replit project.

Context:
- The app is deployed to Vercel from GitHub.
- Package manager: pnpm.
- Vercel build fails with the generic message:

  "Build Failed
   Command \"pnpm install && pnpm build\" exited with 1"

- There is also a `vercel.json` file with this content (or very similar):

  {
    "crons": [
      {
        "path": "/api/revalidate?tag=cms:all",
        "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
      }
    ],
    "buildCommand": "pnpm install && pnpm build",
    "installCommand": "pnpm install --shamefully-hoist --no-optional",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "outputDirectory": ".next"
  }

Your tasks:

1. Open the integrated shell in this Replit and run:
   - `pnpm install`
   - `pnpm build`
   Capture and inspect the **first real error message and stack trace**, not just “Command failed with exit code 1”.

2. Based on that error, fix the actual root cause in the repo. This might be:
   - missing or incorrect scripts in `package.json` (e.g. `"build"` script),
   - TypeScript or ESLint build errors,
   - Next.js config errors,
   - wrong import paths or missing files,
   - pnpm configuration issues.

   IMPORTANT:
   - Make minimal, targeted code changes.
   - Do NOT refactor the app structure.
   - Do NOT remove dependencies unless they are clearly unused and causing the error.

3. Simplify and correct the Vercel build configuration:
   - Change `vercel.json` so that:
     - `buildCommand` is **only** `pnpm build` (Vercel will run `pnpm install` automatically before that).
     - Keep `installCommand` only if necessary; if it is redundant or harmful, remove it.
   - Ensure the final `vercel.json` stays valid JSON and still contains the cron configuration:

     {
       "crons": [
         {
           "path": "/api/revalidate?tag=cms:all",
           "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
         }
       ],
       "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
       "framework": "nextjs",
       "outputDirectory": ".next"
     }

     Adjust `installCommand` only if it is really needed for pnpm in this project.

4. After fixes:
   - Run `pnpm build` again locally in Replit and confirm:
     - the command exits with code 0,
     - there are no TypeScript/Next.js build errors.

5. Do NOT change environment variable names or CMS configuration unless the error explicitly says they are wrong. The goal is to make the build pass, not to redesign the CMS integration.

6. Summarize your changes in 3–6 bullet points:
   - Which files were edited.
   - What the root cause of the `pnpm build` failure was.
   - What exactly was changed in `vercel.json`.
   - Confirmation that `pnpm build` now succeeds locally.

Apply all changes directly in this Replit project so that, once pushed to GitHub, Vercel can run `pnpm build` successfully and deploy without the generic “exited with 1” error.
